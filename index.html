						<p class="project-description">
							An action puzzle game where you have to reach the end of a stage by interacting with objects and encountering enemies.   My responsibility in this work was stage 3. 
							I took part in some mechanic of the game such as enemy script and also helped on other stages as well.
							I put some finishing touch to the game by adding some sound, pause button and dash effect.

							Automatic Boss Enemy Generation in Game
						</h2>
						<p class="project-description">
								My senior (final year) project.  I explored automatic boss generation by creating a very simple mock up of action game. 
								Genetic algorithm was used to generate and select bosses. 
								There is a player AI to play against each boss and get the battle data to be calculated for the fitness value of the boss.

							Small Square Tower Defense
						</h2>
						<p class="project-description">
							Unfortunately, the only thing I can show is documentation of it. It was an old work when I still was new to programming. It was a very simple game written in Java with JavaFX.
