					About Me
				</div>
				<div class="aboutme-body">
					<p>
						I'm a fresh graduate in computer engineering from Chulalongkorn university.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have experiences in backend developing from internship as backend web developer (but did some frontend work as well) at Codium. So I'm familiar with client/server architecture. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I may still don't know much about game industry but I honestly want to join. Games and people I have met in games teach me many things and make me come this far. 
						I have been studying Unity since start of my fourth year. There really are a lot to learn in game development.

							An action puzzle game where you have to reach the end of a stage by interacting with objects and encountering enemies.   My responsibility in this work was stage 3. 
							I took part in some mechanic of the game such as enemy script and also helped on other stages as well.
							I put some finishing touch to the game by adding some sound and dash effect.
