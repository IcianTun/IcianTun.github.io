					About Me
				</div>
				<div class="aboutme-body">
					<p>
						I'm a fresh graduate in computer engineering from Chulalongkorn university.
					</p>
					<p>
						I experienced in backend developing from internship as backend web developer (but did some frontend work as well) at Codium. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I want to do a job in game industry even though I may still don't know much about the game industry. Games and people I have met in games teach me many things and make me come this far. 
						I have been studying Unity since start of my fourth year. There really are a lot to learn in game development.

						<p class="project-description">
							An action puzzle game where you have to reach the end of a stage by interacting with objects and encountering enemies.   My responsibility in this work was stage 3. 
							I took part in some mechanic of the game such as enemy script and also helped on other stages as well.
							I put some finishing touch to the game by adding some sound, pause button and dash effect.

							Automatic Boss Enemy Generation in Game
						</h2>
						<p class="project-description">
								My senior (final year) project.  I explored automatic boss generation by creating a very simple mock up of action game. 
								Genetic algorithm was used to generate and select bosses. 
								There is a player AI to play against each boss and get the battle data to be calculated for the fitness value of the boss.

						<p class="project-description">
							Unfortunately, the only thing I can show is documentation of it. It was an old work when I still was new to programming. It was a very simple game written in Java with JavaFX.
